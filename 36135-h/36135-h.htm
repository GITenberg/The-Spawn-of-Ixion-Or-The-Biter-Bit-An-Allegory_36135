<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When Ixion from heaven was hurl'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hell, to be for ever whirl'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a perpetual damning wheel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pit's eternal pains to feel;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas for a bestial, vulgar deed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereby that mortal did succeed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sinking Juno to the sod&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seducing e'en that beaut'ous god!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Abomination foul, was this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To ruin lovely Juno's bliss!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To raise in heaven domestic strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twixt Jupiter and his lov'd wife!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sins that never were forgiven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To scandalize the court of heaven!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Jupiter in pity took<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
<span class="i0">This wretch to heaven, on earth forsook,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was a vile contempt'ous thing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Despised by peasant, prince and king;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wand'ring vagrant, shun'd and curst,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For sending Æneus to the dust.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The aged father of his wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Base Ixion deprived of life!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into a pit of burning fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He cast poor Æneus to expire!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, while this cruel, murd'rous knave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For sending Æneus to his grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From every circle under heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With scorn contemptuous, was driven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This wretched outcast, here forsaken,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Jupiter, was kindly taken<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the realms above the skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And introduced to deities!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E'en at the tables of the gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He set this scoundrel of the clods!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such heavenly condescension should<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inspire a mortal's gratitude:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Ixion's base and blacken'd breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some thankfulness should even rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His heart, though steep'd in every deed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of darkness, in the devil's creed&mdash;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
<span class="i0">In every sin that stains the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or blackens hell, which gave it birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should now have felt a kindly glow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For what great Jupiter did do.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But Ixion did only feel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A base desire at once to steal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heart of Juno, and to tread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Jupiter's celestial bed!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had an intrigue with the cloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Juno, which the gods allow'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus the monstrous Centaur came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Ixion's and Juno's shame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Jupiter with thunder hurl'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The villain from the heavenly world,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sent him to hell fore'er to feel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ceaseless torments of the wheel.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But his vile offspring stays behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bane and curse of human kind,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Possessing still the bestial fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which deep disgraced and damn'd the sire:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The same inglorious meanness strays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the vile veins and verse and lays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of him, on crutches, devil half,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(At whom his kindred centaurs laugh,)<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
<span class="i0">In that deformity of hell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On whom its attributes have fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In him, whose shameless, wicked life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is with abomination rife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose works, thrice damn'd and doubly dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The produce of conceit and lead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Possess no other aim nor end<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But foul abuse of foe and friend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His heart, polluted with the dung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of demons damn'd, from hell out flung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is rotten to the core with lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From which foul slanders thickly rise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His soul, most pitiful and mean,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Infected with hell-scorch'd gangrene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No kind, redeeming trait contains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But reeks with bestial blots and stains.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His mind, with vulgar vice imbued,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Libidinous and low and lewd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep stained with malice, hate and spleen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sentiments supremely mean,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is bent on mischief, foul as hell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er which the hideous Centaurs yell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Low was his birth and low his name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Low is his life, and low his fame;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But lower still the depths of wo,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Park, when dead and damn'd, must go.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Friends, foes or fiends, alike he fights,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all he says, or sings, or writes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This foul defamer, crawling round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The brink of hell, to catch its sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exsudes it thence, in doleful rhyme,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Debased and reeking rank with crime.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">On this deformity of man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More monstrous than the bastard Pan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pegasus turn'd his nimble feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Park, on crutches, crawl'd the street;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Urging that steed, against his will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bear him up Helicon's hill.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Pegasus, a knowing horse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perceived that Park's conceited verse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was only suited to the stews<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of hell, whence emanates his muse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He, therefore, with Bellerophon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Left him behind, well trampled on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To tune a pilfer'd, broken lyre,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In fields of mud, and muck, and mire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there, his song most lowly set,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Winding through marshes, undulcet,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Contending always with the fog,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unable e'er to flee the bog,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Does charm, perhaps, the frogs and snakes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And loathsome reptiles of the lakes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Although some demon's wand'ring sprite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May, haply, listen with delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Park's low, grov'ling, growling song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As, through the sloughs, it pours along;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And though in marshes, fens and ditches,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It may, perhaps, amuse the witches;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, should an unsuspecting team<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hear, unawares, the dismal scream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his lugubr'ous, muck-born verse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twould sadly frighten every horse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, had the Children in the Wood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just heard his strain, and understood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its wretched, wrangling, dismal din,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How frighten'd had those children been!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Believing soon that doom would crack,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or that the de'il was on their track!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had Robert Kid, that pirate knave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard it come creaking o'er the wave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had supposed some demon's shell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was sounding from the gates of hell.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The red men, savage, wild and rude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep buried in their solitude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would wake affrighted from their dreams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If, haply, Park's poetic screams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should penetrate their secret lair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they, forthwith, would kneel in prayer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the great Spirit of the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Believing that their days were done;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That hell's dark hole was open thrown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that this strain was Satan's own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In wrath, now prowling through the wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Devouring Indians for his food.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Ev'n David Crockett would have run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Affrighted, from his game and gun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had he but heard, in woods remote,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Park's incongruous jangling note,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wild screeching on the western gale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An unpoetic dismal wail:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor stopp'd in his despairing flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In San Jacinto, e'en, to fight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, rushing wildly and forlorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E'en to the billows, off Cape Horn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most likely there, himself had drown'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In terror of the doleful sound.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
<span class="i0">In western wilds, had Daniel Boon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But heard, for once, the lecherous loon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He would have dropp'd his axe and gun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, to the eastward, rapid run;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor stay'd, in all his fearful flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For wind or storm, through day and night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till he some civil spot could reach,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uncursed by Park's dolorous screech.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And had Columbus heard his roar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When first he landed on this shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He would have turn'd his bark amain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never ventured here again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Impress'd that, in this western world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was, from Pandemonium hurl'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some spirit damn'd for e'er to bark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hideous songs of hideous Park.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The owls and bats that curse the land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could they but hear and understand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wretched rhymes and nauseous stuff<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of this conceited, vile ruff-skuff,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would, surely, leave their secret haunts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ever cease their nightly chants;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Convinced that they have been, at last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In frightful strains, by Park surpast;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And that this vagrant of the muse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Foul caterer for sinks and stews,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Five-Points' poet, has outdone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All they have ever screech'd or sung.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Despairing, thence, they would retire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long distance from his loathsome lyre,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let their lonely caves and rocks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resound with his poetic shocks;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be, perhaps, all rent in twain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By his unearthly, rumbling strain.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As I was musing on this theme,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I fell asleep, and had a dream:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw the fish that skim the deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And o'er the billows nimbly leap,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All sink beneath the boiling wave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down to the lowest depths, to lave:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For they had heard the dismal lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Park come booming down the bay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, doubtless, thought some hungry shark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was chasing them with hellish bark;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That his sharp teeth, already nigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would them destroy, and they must die;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That there, alas, was no escape<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From his terrific gab and gape,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And that their gamb'ling, watery run<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was, now, alas, for ever done!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as they, deep in ocean's ink,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Despairing, to the bottom sink,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'erwhelm'd by that infernal sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They cast a gloomy gaze around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And call'd on Neptune, sea-throned god,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To smite the rascal with his rod&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pierce him with his trident spear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pitch him into hell to sear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To stew, and fry, in Satan's dish,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For frightening thus, poor harmless fish.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But Neptune, monarch of the main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With scorn contempt'ous and disdain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look'd down on Park's lugubrious rhyme,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hasten'd o'er the boiling brine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unheedful of the fishes' cry&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And left them, with Park's songs, to die!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His foaming horses now he lash'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, through the boisterous billows, dash'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Affrighted at the dismal strain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now wildly screeching o'er the main.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The god of ocean's angry wave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Desirous, only, now, to save<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Himself from that unearthly screech,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flew, swift, with might and main, to reach<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The portals of the heavenly world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whence Ixion, disgraced, was hurl'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there, to gods assembled, tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What lately, in the sea, befell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The finny tribes, that swim the deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now sunk, perhaps, in endless sleep!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The hosts of heaven, when Neptune came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With foaming horses, from the main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rejoiced to see the briny king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The golden gates, wide open, fling;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, anxiously, all beg to know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tidings from the world below?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Great Neptune, their celestial guest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With haste, thus answer'ed their request:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O Jove, high heaven's majestic king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To whom all gods due homage bring:"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(And now the monarch of the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With awful reverence, bows the knee),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I come in haste, and wish to tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How an infernal fiend from hell,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An Ixion spawn,&mdash;kick'd down from heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And through the earth, a vagrant, driven,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
<span class="i0">A cast-off lyre, hath stol'n or begg'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which he, with hempen strings, hath rigg'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now, the ocean, creeks, and bays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Makes, nightly, hideous, with his lays!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Last night, as I was going to bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The villain struck the fish all dead!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His dismal strain, they can't abide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It smote their ears, and lo, they died!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My noble steeds, affrighted, too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like lightning, through the billows, flew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor could, the hellish note, divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That creak'd, terrific, o'er the brine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, even, I, myself, was shock'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from my chariot, nearly knock'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the boisterous, boiling sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By that astounding minstrelsy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, now, by all the gods above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By all that men or angels love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I call for thunderbolts or fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To dash this scoundrel and his lyre!"<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Great Jupiter, with horror struck,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In wrath, the heavenly mansion shook;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And order'd Vulcan, quick, to forge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thunderbolt, tremendous large,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With which he smote the venal ghost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cast him into hell, to roast!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Now, aught &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash; ever wrote,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let none but fiends incarnate, quote;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, why should men or angels name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What only sprites infernal claim;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, why should men, to darkness, turn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hell-curs'd villain's verse, to learn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, in poetic marshes, grope,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To save a scoundrel from the rope;&mdash;<br /></span>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
